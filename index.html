    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> From an early age, we are often told that learning goes beyond the classroom, and this idea remains true.
      Education is not limited to the content taught in lectures, but is also shaped by how knowledge is applied, practiced, 
      and reflected on outside the traditional classroom setting. While the founders of education have held us to this standard, 
      it is time we move beyond the classroom and understand how Virtual Reality (VR) can transform learning as we know it.  </p>
    
    <p> VR is defined by the University of Baltimore as "a computer-generated, immersive, and interactive experience that simulates a three-dimensional environment, 
      often with the aid of specialized hardware such as headsets and controllers." (UMB Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning, n.d.). 
      In short, VR is an emerging educational technology that allows students to engage with immersive simulations and lectures. </p>

    <p> Incorporating VR can make a significant impact in the education industry, especially alongside other learning styles,
      for example, visual learners who might benefit from moving away from traditional classroom settings and are heavily reliant on lectures and textbooks. 
      Additionally, VR provides the excitement that many students crave in academia and can raise student engagement.</p>
