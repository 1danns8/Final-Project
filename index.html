    <h1> Virtual Reality In Education  </h1>

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> From an early age, we are often told that learning goes beyond the classroom, and this idea remains true.
      Education is not limited to the content taught in lectures, but is also shaped by how knowledge is applied, practiced, 
      and reflected on outside the traditional classroom setting. While the founders of education have held us to this standard, 
      it is time we move beyond the classroom and understand how Virtual Reality (VR) can transform learning as we know it.  </p>
    
    <p> VR is defined by the University of Baltimore as "a computer-generated, immersive, and interactive experience that simulates a three-dimensional environment, 
      often with the aid of specialized hardware such as headsets and controllers." (UMB Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning, n.d.). 
      In short, VR is an emerging educational technology that allows students to engage with immersive simulations and lectures. </p>

    <p> Incorporating VR can make a significant impact in the education industry, especially alongside other learning styles,
      for example, visual learners who might benefit from moving away from traditional classroom settings and are heavily reliant on lectures and textbooks. 
      Additionally, VR provides the excitement that many students crave in academia and can raise student engagement.</p>

    <h2> VR for medical & Nursing Training  </h2>
    <p> Osso VR is a top virtual reality surgical training platform used by medical schools and hospitals including Harvard Medical School, UCSF, and the Mayo Clinic. It allows students and doctors to perform surgical operations in a realistic 3D environment with a VR headset and controls.

<p> Context & How It Is Used
VR is used to provide medical and nursing students with hands-on, risk-free experience. Students enter a virtual operating room, follow step-by-step instructions, carry out surgical procedures, and receive immediate feedback. They can practice treatments as many times as they want, honing their skills, confidence, and skills before treating patients.
 </p> 
    

    <p> Social Challenges
Cost and Access: VR equipment is expensive, resulting in disparities between high- and low-budget programs.
Skill Transfer: Virtual reality cannot totally substitute real-world patient experience or human mentoring.
Technical issues include motion sickness, limited realism, and the necessity for IT support.
Data Concerns: Student performance data may pose privacy and evaluation issues. </p>

 <p>  Why This Matters
VR training enhances patient safety, boosts student confidence, and standardises medical education. However, it presents problems about equity, realism, and privacy, all of which must be addressed before fair and effective adoption can occur.
