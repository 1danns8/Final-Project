    <h1> Virtual Reality In Education  </h1>
<!-- ======================= 
    <!-- Alicia Davis = intro & tech -->

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> From an early age, we are often told that learning goes beyond the classroom, and this idea remains true.
      Education is not limited to the content taught in lectures, but is also shaped by how knowledge is applied, practiced, 
      and reflected on outside the traditional classroom setting. While the founders of education have held us to this standard, 
      it is time we move beyond the classroom and understand how Virtual Reality (VR) can transform learning as we know it.  </p>
    
    <p> VR is defined by the University of Baltimore as "a computer-generated, immersive, and interactive experience that simulates a three-dimensional environment, 
      often with the aid of specialized hardware such as headsets and controllers." (UMB Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning, n.d.). 
      In short, VR is an emerging educational technology that allows students to engage with immersive simulations and lectures. </p>

    <p> Incorporating VR can make a significant impact in the education industry, especially alongside other learning styles,
      for example, visual learners who might benefit from moving away from traditional classroom settings and are heavily reliant on lectures and textbooks. 
      Additionally, VR provides the excitement that many students crave in academia and can raise student engagement.</p>

    <h2> VR for medical & Nursing Training  </h2>
    <p> Osso VR is a top virtual reality surgical training platform used by medical schools and hospitals including Harvard Medical School, UCSF, and the Mayo Clinic. It allows students and doctors to perform surgical operations in a realistic 3D environment with a VR headset and controls.

<p> Context & How It Is Used
VR is used to provide medical and nursing students with hands-on, risk-free experience. Students enter a virtual operating room, follow step-by-step instructions, carry out surgical procedures, and receive immediate feedback. They can practice treatments as many times as they want, honing their skills, confidence, and skills before treating patients.
 </p> 
    

    <p> Social Challenges
Cost and Access: VR equipment is expensive, resulting in disparities between high- and low-budget programs.
Skill Transfer: Virtual reality cannot totally substitute real-world patient experience or human mentoring.
Technical issues include motion sickness, limited realism, and the necessity for IT support.
Data Concerns: Student performance data may pose privacy and evaluation issues. </p>

 <p>  Why This Matters
VR training enhances patient safety, boosts student confidence, and standardises medical education. However, it presents problems about equity, realism, and privacy, all of which must be addressed before fair and effective adoption can occur.

<h2>Application Case Study #2 – VR Field Trips (Daniel)</h2>

    <h3>Real-World Example: Google Arts &amp; Culture VR</h3>

    <img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6632-6134-4732-b536-353536363365/pexels-photo-4144179.jpeg"

    <p>
      Google Expeditions was one of the most widely used VR classroom tools before being integrated into Google Arts &amp;
      Culture, which now provides VR-based virtual field trips used in K–12 classrooms around the world. The platform
      allows students to explore historical sites, museums, and cultural landmarks in immersive 360&deg; environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Google Arts &amp; Culture VR is used to bring real-world locations into the classroom, especially for subjects like
      history, geography, and world cultures. Instead of learning from a textbook alone, students can virtually walk
      through ancient ruins, explore the Great Wall of China, or experience life inside historic civilizations. Teachers
      guide the experience by selecting destinations, highlighting points of interest, and using prompts to support class
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of these VR field trips is to deepen student engagement, make distant concepts more tangible, and support
      different learning styles — especially visual and experiential learners who benefit from interactive environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethical and Social Concerns</h3>
    <p>
      One major concern with VR field trips is inequitable access. Many schools cannot afford VR headsets or lack the
      required internet speeds, which creates a divide where wealthier districts benefit from immersive learning while
      underfunded schools fall behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another issue is accuracy and cultural representation. If VR designers portray historical events or locations in a
      simplified or biased way, students may form misunderstandings about important cultural or historical topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teacher readiness also presents challenges. Without proper training, educators may struggle to integrate VR into
      lesson plans, reducing effectiveness and causing confusion. VR platforms may also collect student interaction or
      performance data, raising privacy concerns that schools must manage carefully to protect minors.

    <!-- Thinh = Ethical analysis -->
    <h2>Ethical Analysis and Reccomendations </h2>
    
    <h2> Ethical Analysis </h2>
    
    <h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
    Definition: The actions are ethically right if they bring benefit for the greatest number of people.
    VR Analysis:
      VR can increase student engagement across three dimensions: cognitive (thinking), behavioral (actions), and affective (emotional).
      Cognitive engagement: Help students understand complex content more deeply through interactive 3D environments.
      Behavioral engagement: Encourage students to study actively through improving attendance, assignment completion, and classroom participation.
      Affective engagement: Increase students’ motivation, interest, and even empathy through role-play or adaptive learning, for those with emotional or learning difficulties.
      VR is especially effective for students with: Learning disabilities or struggling in traditional classrooms, by providing personalized or adaptive learning environments.
    Potential harms:
      Many schools may face barriers when applying VR into teaching, including lack of teacher proficiency and insufficient technical support.
      Poor implementation could reduce overall benefits of VR, resulting in frustration, wasted resources, and ineffective learning.
    Ethical key point: From an utilitarian perspective, VR has potential because it can significantly improve student engagement and learning outcomes, but benefits are maximized only when it is well-implemented.
    <h3>Justice / Fairness</h3>
    Definition: Create systems that treats everyone fairly, ensuring that technology's benefits and challenges are balanced with decisions are made through transparent, unbiased processes
    VR Analysis:
      Offer adaptive and personalized learning, which can help students with learning disabilities or special needs, promoting educational equity.
      Support students who struggle in traditional classrooms by making complex content more accessible, adapting diverse learning styles.
    Equity risks:
      Many schools may lack readiness in teacher training and technical support, causing students cannot take fully VR benefits.
      Unequal access could leave many under-resourced schools fall behind, students in these schools have fewer learning opportunities which is increasing educational inequality.
    Ethical key point: VR is ethically potential if training and resources support are provided to ensure fair distribution of benefits.

    <p>  how conclusions change based on each lens </p>
    Utilitarianism: Emphasize maximizing overall benefits. VR should be widely applied to increase engagement, learning outcomes, and student well-being if properly implemented.
    Justice / Fairness: Emphasize fair distribution. VR deployment must ensure access and support for all students to avoid gaps in learning.
